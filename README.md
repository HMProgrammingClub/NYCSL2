NYCSL, or the New York Computer Science League, is an online, high school programming competition.

Each month at midnight a new challenge is posted. Programmers in NYCSL have one month to upload as many solutions as they like; only the top score is shown. Solutions are instantly graded and put up on both global and school-wide leaderboards. Problems are designed such that they are suitable for programmers of all skill levels; beginners are encouraged to participate.

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```$ git clone https://github.com/HMProgrammingClub/NYCSL2.git```
